"Welcome to another week of power rankings. The week of trades, I’ve never gotten more texts about guys on my team. Perhaps it’s BYE week hell. Perhaps people are getting a little antsy and sick of looking at the same guys in their lineups every week. \n \nGood job to the 10 people who voted. A reminder to the folks like Steve, make sure you are voting on the newest link send via text every week. Steve’s votes haven’t counted for the last 5 weeks because he kept voting on week 1. \n \nWho is going to separate themselves from the pack? Things are looking awfully clustered at the 4-2 and 3-3 marks. These weeks can put you in the playoffs or send your ass home. Week 7, let’s go."}
