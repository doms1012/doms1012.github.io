"Week 6 is now here and we have quite the logjam of teams at 3-2 on the year. Now that we’re up in the guts of the regular season, are we going to see contenders begin to separate themselves from the pretenders of the league? There are only 6 playoff spots, what will you do to ensure you’re still in it at the end of the year? \n \nThanks for all the votes this week, not even a birthday can keep me from delivering power rankings each week (please someone help me write, I am running out of jokes). 10 votes is a solid showing, still waiting for the week where everyone votes.\n\nLet’s dive headfirst into the shallow end of Week 6 rankings.
