"Welcome to another year of fantasizing about football and another year of power rankings. We’re switching to a live website and instead of one person ranking teams each week, we will be voting on rankings each week. Shoutout to those of you who responded to the poll and ranked the teams. To those of you who didn’t, you can't see me right now but I’m shaking my damn head (SMDH). \n\n It’s time to separate the men from the boys, contenders from the pretenders, and the dicks from the balls. It’s been a long time without football and I have missed watching Redzone while listening to half our league in an Xbox party cream their pants over every 4-yard catch and 2-yard rush every Sunday. I can’t wait to get my hopes up again this year and to have them crushed each week while slowly watching me throw $125 dollars away over 14 weeks. \n\n Week 1 Power Rankings, let’s go. "
