"Somebody wake up that guy from Green Day, it’s the end of September and Week 4 is here. Solid participation in the power rankings this week, two individuals neglected to submit their votes and let their leaguemates down. /n/n Slightly disappointed that no trades were hammered out at Sam’s wedding. But I have a sneaking suspicion that a number of you were watching Sunday football slightly hungover last week. Personally, the mix of chocolate cake, Budweiser and Jager made for a wonderful morning after and the 4 shits I took before kickoff were completely unrelated.  /n/nWeek 4, coming in hot."}
