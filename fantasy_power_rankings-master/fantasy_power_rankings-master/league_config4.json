"Here we are in Week 3, another week gone and another week closer to the grave. Shout-out to the 8 people who voted this week on Power Rankings you are true pimps. To those of you who didn’t vote this week, maybe think about the lives sacrificed to guarantee you the right to vote and then you can feel like a piece of shit. \n \nQuin came in clutch and assisted with the write-ups this week. We’re like Stockton and Malone, except both of us are white. Try to guess which one of us wrote your team’s description and win a prize (our nuts in your mouth). \n\nGet ready to be stimulated by Week 3’s Power Rankings. "}
